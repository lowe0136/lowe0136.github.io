        <p> I am a student at Algonquin college enrolled in the Interactive Media Design Program. I enjoy the things I study such as photography, graphic design and coding. I first realized I was interested in media design at the age of 14 when I took my first photography class in highschool, I knew it was for me when I realized it was the only class I didn't dislike going to and the enviroment allowed me to meet my full potential.</p>
        <p> I have always worked well with technology and always planned to do something with computers when I got out of highschool. In my free time I like to take hikes in nature with my friends, I enjoy leaving my phone at home and connecting with nature without distractions. Typically I spend most of my time with my girlfriend and her dog, we live together and help eachtother everyday with school work and any other problems we face. </p>
